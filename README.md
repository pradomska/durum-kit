# durum-kit

Durum Kit is a mini application that helped me learn key concepts in JavaScript, including the DOM Model, event handling, and HTML element manipulation.

## 🔥 What Did I Learn?
- **DOM Model** – how it works and how to manipulate it.
- **Event Listeners** – handling user interactions.
- **Dynamic HTML and CSS Manipulation** – changing content, classes, and styles on the fly.
- **Data Structures** – organizing information within the application.

## 🚀 App Features
- Create and edit Durum ingredients 🌯.
- Interactive user handling through clicks and forms.
